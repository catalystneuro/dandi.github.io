## Our collaboration policies are:

- Authorship is a function of intellectual contribution and we try to minimize
author bloat in our group. For multi-institution student collaborations, we will
identify ahead of time who the primary advisers and collaborators are on a
project.
- Our work is open. However, there have been prior situations where we have
applied for patents during collaborations.
- We tend to share any data we collect and any code we produce under open
licenses (data: PDDL, code: Apache 2.0, doc: CC-BY)
- Any digital research work we produce together should be re-executable and hopefully
reproducible/generalizable.
