# Research

A fundamental problem in psychiatry is that there are no biological markers for
diagnosing mental illness or for indicating how best to treat it. Treatment
decisions are based entirely on symptoms, and doctors and their patients will
typically try one treatment, then if it does not work, try another, and perhaps
another. Our group hopes to change this picture, and our research suggests
that individual brain scans and speaking patterns can hold valuable information
for guiding psychiatrists and patients. Current areas include depression,
suicide, anxiety disorders, autism, Parkinson disease, and brain tumors.

To support this broader goal, our group develops novel analytic platforms that
use such information to create robust, predictive models around human health.

Our research interests span computer science and neuroscience, specifically in
the areas of applied machine learning, signal processing, and translational
medicine. Our current research portfolio comprises projects on spoken
communication, brain imaging, and informatics to address gaps in scientific
knowledge in three areas: the neural basis and translational applications of
speaking, precision psychiatry and medicine, and preserving information for
reproducible research.

Many of the tools we develop can be used across domains. If you have a
need we can address, we would like to hear from you.

If you have solved problems associated with any of the projects below, we would
love to hear from you. For us, a solution typically implies available data,
code, and/or replicated results.
