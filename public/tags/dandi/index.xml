      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-need-for-external-files&#34;&gt;The need for external files&lt;a class=&#34;td-heading-self-link&#34; href=&#34;#the-need-for-external-files&#34; aria-label=&#34;Heading self-link&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neurophysiology experiments often include natural videos (such as behaving animals), which need to be stored with the neurophysiological recordings in order to ensure maximal reusability of the data. These videos are commonly stored with lossy compression (e.g. h264 in an .mp4 file), which allows them to achieve very high compression ratios. It is possible to read these videos frame-by-frame, and store them in HDF5, but since HDF5 is not able to access popular video codecs like h264, the volume of the video in the NWB file is much larger (even when using the available compression algorithms like GZIP). NWB has an option to avoid storing these altogether by linking to these external video files using a relative path to that file on disk. This relative path is stored in the ImageSeries neurodata_type storing it as an attribute of a string dtype. We also need to publish these video linked NWB files in an archive (e.g. in DANDI). For DANDI, which renames and reorganizes the the NWB files, this requires not only uploading the video file on the archive but also changing the path attribute of the ImageSeries to reflect the new file names.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
